Project Overview

This analysis is an optional Capstone project completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate (Coursera). The goal is to apply the full data analytics workflow—ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act—using real-world wearable fitness data.

Background

Bellabeat is a wellness technology company founded in 2013 that designs beautifully crafted, health-focused smart products for women. Bellabeat’s mission is to empower women through data by helping them better understand their health habits, activity patterns, and lifestyle behaviors.

Urška Sršen (Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer) believes that analyzing non-Bellabeat consumer wearable data—specifically Fitbit fitness tracker usage—can uncover actionable insights that translate into stronger product positioning and more effective marketing strategies.

Business Task

Analyze Fitbit Fitness Tracker App data to understand how consumers use wearable devices and identify patterns in activity, sleep, and daily habits. Use these findings to generate data-driven recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy and customer engagement.

Key Business Questions 1. What trends and behaviors are present in wearable usage data? 2. How might these trends apply to Bellabeat customers (women-focused wellness audience)? 3. How can these insights influence Bellabeat’s marketing strategy, messaging, and product focus?
